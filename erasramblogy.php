                <p>erasram is a new generation web platform designed for erasmus students to find each other. In this way, it has been developed for students who are lonely in the country they are going to, people who want to adapt to their destination beforehand, and people who want to see who will go there to find each other and talk about the region. Users can provide one-to-one contact with them by entering their Instagram user names, in addition, they can get views by using the chat room of the country they will go to.
It is enough to register in the system to do all of these.</p>
