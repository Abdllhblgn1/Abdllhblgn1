                    <p>Erasram is a new generation web platform designed for erasmus students to find each other. In this way, it has been developed for students who are lonely in the country they are going to, people who want to adapt to their destination beforehand, and people who want to see who will go there to find each other and talk about the region.</p>

                    <p>More than 9 million people have participated to the Erasmus program since its creation. The number of young participants has increased significantly since 1987. Nearly 300,000 a year[when?] compared with only 3,244 in 1987. Spain is the country that allowed most people to participate to Erasmus with more than 40,000 per year, ahead of France, Germany and Italy. The countries receiving the most students are Spain with more than 39,000 students and then Germany.[21] There are currently more than 4,000 higher institutions participating in Erasmus across the 37 countries. In 2012–13, 270,000 took part, the most popular destinations being Spain, Germany, Italy and France.[22] Erasmus students represented 5 percent of European graduates as of 2012.[23]</p>
